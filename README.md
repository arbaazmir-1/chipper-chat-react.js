## This isn't very polished as this was a late night 2 hours project.
I gave firebase firestore a shot with this, which is why this isn't the most top notch application. The functionalities are there but designs are meh and it throws
error sometimes. I know, I know, another dumb unpolished project but I will be creating one with nicer ui and will publish it later on. Maybe not this year as I am diving deeper into Ml & Deep Learning
